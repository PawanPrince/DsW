            <h2>The Universe is not made up of atoms but rather magic!</h2>
            <p>Over all these years, we’ve been fortunate to capture some timeless moments. Moments that skip a beat &
                spark a soul. Moments which would forever echo in the realm of magic.</p>
            <p>This Journey has not been easy, either. We’ve been challenged, we,ve evolved, we’ve been humbled to
                experience the sheer profoundness of human emotions.</p>
            <p> We believe everyone has a story to unfold. A story that could make you smile, give you goosebumps, or
                make you shed some happy tears.</p>
            <p>As Paulo Coelho once said “ We are travellers on a cosmic journey, stardust, swirling & dancing in the
                eddies & whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other,
                to meet, to love, to share.This is a precious moment. It has parenthesis in eternity.”</p>
            <p> Now in this very moment, as you stumbled upon this page, we would like to tell your tale to the world.
                A tale which will forever be etched in our 2x2 polaroid, a story which makes your heart full for years
                to come.</p>
